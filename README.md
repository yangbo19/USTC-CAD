# Combining Ant System Algorithm and Simulated Annealing for 3D/2D Fixed-Outline Floorplanning
We proposed a two-phase algorithm for 3D/2D Fixed-Outline Floorplanning with minimization of wirelength and through silicon vias. The AS algorithm is used to globally generate solutions in the first phase, which are then improved by the SA-based searching algorithm in the second phase. During AS phase, a probability layer assignment strategy is proposed to determine the layer assignment of blocks. Compared with some previous fixed-outline floorplanners, two-phase algorithm is very effective.
